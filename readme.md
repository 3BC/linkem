# LinkEm

A useful utility to manage links.

Since [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) has started we figured it was a good time to tackle an issue we have been wanting to solve for sometime now...

In large (or even small) organizations there tends to be heaps of different links you need to remember and while there are tools to help with this via bookmark managers, there wasn't anything to act as a central repo of links so that organizations could manage the links themselves for the less... technical users.

So our goal is to create a useful utility to manage links but also allow a better way to share and distribute links from any internet connected device.
